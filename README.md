# About
Hello, you've stumbled upon a collection of source code of GDI Malware made by various people <br>
Now I've spent my time here collecting and publishing source code to make it as easy as clicking a button to view it. No more downloading archive files to view source code of that one malware!

Of course, be careful when handling code from other people. Even if you can see it, you don't want to carelessly run it!

If any code has `CreateFileW` and the first parameter contains `\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive0`, don't run it! `\\.\PhysicalDrive0` is the location of the [Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) which you need to boot into Windows!

# Questions n Answers

- **Q**: *I want my code removed from here, how can get it removed?* <br> **A**: Contact me via discord: *the_xj*
